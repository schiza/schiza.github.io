Programmer, nerd, gamer.

I love games so why not share some good stuff, or warn about not-so-good ones?

This will be a place for short opinions, thoughts, sometimes rants and other stuff - all about games I played. Don't expect any super long and full-fledged reviews ;)

I play a lot of different genres, including quite niche games. PC and occasionally PS4 (mostly exclusives, but also some games I already owned).
