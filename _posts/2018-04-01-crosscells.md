A relaxing, ambient logic game focused on simple math.

Relaxing music. Minimalistic style. "Water drops" animations and sounds. And simple rules. CrossCells is a game based on some simple math operations and checking/unchecking boxes with numbers.

We're progressing through the puzzles, introduced with more and more mechanics, making the puzzles more complicated and needing more time to solve. Starting with simple "sum of squares in column/row", "count of squares in column/row", but later introducing other mechanics like multiplication, totals/counts in given area and making the boards and combinations more complicated. For anyone interested in math-driven puzzles and some elimination and deduction, it's a great game. Minimalistic and relaxing style, great implementation and gameplay and a really smooth and good progression of difficulty - make a really great logic game.
