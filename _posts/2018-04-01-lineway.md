"Draw a line by one stroke" logic game.

As for many logic games, LineWay takes a couple of things and mix them: simple, minimalistic, but not as easy. Your goal? Draw a line, with one stroke, filling all the squares on the board. Sounds simple enough, but gets complicated with time.

The creators fiddled a lot with the idea - as we progress, there are more and more elements: "walls" blocking our way, locks that need to be open first, more than 1 colour and others. This keeps the game fresh, even if it's a pretty short one. All in all, it's a fun game to play and kill some time, but only just that.
