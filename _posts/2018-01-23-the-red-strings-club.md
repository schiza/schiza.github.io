An amazing story, set in a cyberpunk world.

This game just got released, and I was observing it for a while. I actually grabbed it right after it got released and... finished it at one sitting, just a few minutes ago. And wow, the story is so good.

Set in a cyberpunk world, the main character is a bartender in the Red Strings Club - a place not like any other, known for the amazing drinks that "tap into one's emotions". And it's not only a metaphor - you are preparing those drinks, having incredible skillset that allow you to compose drinks that are actually "hitting the spot" and dedicated exactly for your customer, to enhance their emotions. And you listen. You ask questions. Because you're not only a bartender - you're also a data broker: collecting information and selling them is also a thing you do.

We have everything cyberpunk related here - "evil" corporations, implants, androids, while still not being a "pew pew aliens" sci-fi setting. Pixel retro style is actually fitting to the game, and the art is really leveraging it - as well as the music: although sparse at times, it really brings up the mood.

The game is mostly based on dialogues - which are telling the story, but also from which you push the story forward and make important decisions. It's either asking right questions, at the right time (or not asking them), but also answering questions. All of this is shaping the story happening, but also... Well, no spoilers :) There are also some gameplay elements, like actually composing and pouring drinks, which are a nice pause in between the story and let you immerse in the game.

But what makes this game truly amazing is the story. Revolving around meaning of life, society, ethics - asking difficult questions as well as landing some brutal answers. It's a damn good one, making you stop and think what character you actually want to be - but also leaves you moved by the fundamentals touched here (and probably ones that you didn't really put much thought about). It's like a really deep and thoughtful discussion.

I can't recommend it more - I feel like the story (or one of many versions of it, because there is a lot of possibilities how the story will go) could easily make a great movie or book. But what makes it better in a game, is that it's shaped how you wanted... And I think I will definitely replay it, to see how different it might go.
