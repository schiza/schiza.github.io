A short point & click adventure, full of satire and absurd, created from renaissance paintings.

A man wants to go to a church, to confess. What you are seeing seems kind of weird, but familiar - all the characters look.. somewhat familiar, but not exactly fitting to each other and... oh right, they are from renaissance paintings! A minute later, when you learn why the man cannot get his confession and what he has to do you can say "what the hell?".

The game is a masterpiece - and yes, that is a pun. Place and characters in the game, are directly taken from famous paintings from the renaissance era. All of this looks like short-animations known from Monty Python sketches.. but that's not the only thing that is similar to the British comedy group. The game is packed with absurds, satire, jokes and references, both those fitting those old times like also modern ones.

Without spoiling the details - your goal is to commit 7 deadly sins. Yep, did I mention a lot of cheeky jokes from religion? ;) So you travel through the land and the city, trying to get creative and commit those sins. With some classic adventure game approach, talking to people and gathering items to use elsewhere, you need to use your wits (and really think outside of the box) to achieve your goal.

The game takes like 60-90 minutes, but the amount of times I was laughing, facepalming or just blinking trying to understand how someone thought about that, was pretty big. I totally recommend checking descriptions of paintings in the art gallery ;) For everyone loving absurd humour, totally recommended. For mobile players, it's also available on both Android and iOS.
