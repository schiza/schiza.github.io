Short, but great and creative logic game.

I know I'm a sucker for logic games. And those creators already had a couple of good ones. PUSH is a another example of great logic game.

Creative idea, expanded every couple of levels, no instructions - just simpler levels at the beginning for you to understand the new concept - and on to harder challenges. All with really nice, but minimalistic visuals, and ambient music. Very relaxing, mildly challenging at some points - but ideas in there are really good. Like many of those games, it's sadly very short, but again - for $1? I applaud and recommend.
