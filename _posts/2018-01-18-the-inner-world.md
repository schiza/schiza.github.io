Cute adventure game, with a nice hand drawn style and a good sense of humour.

Not a fresh one, released in 2013, but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable! Hand-drawn style is still looking good, although the lower resolution is slightly visible.. but that isn't the important thing in an adventure game.

What definitely hits the spot in this one is the humour - the main character, Robert, is so ridiculously oblivious about many things (well, who wouldn't be, after being kept inside for all their life?) that it's adorable, not mentioning funny situations he gets into. It's also an interesting world creation, uncovering the story piece by piece.

From gameplay standpoint, it's a pretty classic point & click adventure game, with some interesting puzzles. The story is divided into chapters, so you only have a couple of locations at your disposal at a time, so there is no ridiculous backtracking or endless possibilities of things to do - which is good, and makes it more enjoyable.

You could say it's kind of a "kids friendly" adventure game, especially because of the comic-like art style, but it's definitely a cool game :) Second part of it, The Last Wind Monk, was released last year and I'll definitely play it!
