A short (and free) game, telling a story from the past.

You are in a house. Talking about the past, but things are vague. You uncover the memories and what happened then, by going through the Marie's room (or rather memories of that room, reading through her journal). You get to know Marie and Kelsey, their story, with quite a lot of background and events that happened in their youth... and ones that shaped their lives.

When I saw it the first time, I thought about [Gone Home](https://store.steampowered.com/app/232430/Gone_Home/){:target="_blank"}, which is similar in terms of mechanics, and general idea of the game. I definitely also got some vibes from [Life is Strange](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/56692/){:target="_blank"} series - similar music bits, youth story with some "bumps"..

It's probably hard to say a lot about a game that is around 40 minutes long. But in that short time, it told a quite interesting story, with a somewhat unexpected ending. For someone who enjoyed Gone Home or Life is Strange, it definitely one to check out - especially that it's for free on Steam :)
