A first of series, introducing logic and puzzle games.

I'm a sucker for logic and puzzle games - from time to time, I have an urge to get those brain cells moving and figure out some puzzles or master some intricate logic game. I'm still amazed how many great and unique games of that type are available (and still being created!). Most of them incorporating a great minimalistic style and design, often very relaxing one.

I decided to share those games with you too, but in a form of "packs" of them at one go. Here's a first batch (well, there was one already, but without proper descriptions, on [My Games of 2017]({% post_url 2018-01-02-my-games-of-2017 %}){:target="_blank"} list, but let's not get too technical).

- [Collisions]({% post_url 2018-04-01-collisions %}){:target="_blank"}
- [CrossCells]({% post_url 2018-04-01-crosscells %}){:target="_blank"}
- [Hexcells Plus]({% post_url 2018-04-01-hexcells-plus %}){:target="_blank"}
- [LineWay]({% post_url 2018-04-01-lineway %}){:target="_blank"}
