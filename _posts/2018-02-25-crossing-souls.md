Go back to the 80s, solve the mystery and save your family (and the world) with your pack of friends!

For some reason, the 80s are so recognizable and stylish. Clothes, music, movies, style, games... all of those are known for us, even if we didn't live back then - it's a part of culture that's considered classic and known. Crossing Souls is using that in every aspect - diving into 80s culture and giving a game that is modern, but still with the retro style for both graphics and gameplay.

Go on to adventure with your pack of friends - where everyone is different, and representing some archetype of characters. Wait, if you have a pack of friends, is it an RPG? No, it's a peculiar mix of adventure and arcade, with some puzzles involved. You switch between characters you control, using their different movement and abilities to travel and fight. It's a cool concept and it's played out well - no character is "useless" or "unused", because they are all needed at some point.

As I said, the game is doing a great job in showing the 80s culture, as well as in giving that retro style to the gameplay. The pixel graphics look really nice, and there are some occasional comics-like cut scenes. To not spoil anything, I can only say that the story is pretty cool, clinging to some stereotypes and archetypes, but definitely an original one.

The core of the gameplay is a mixture of platforming (with some occasional puzzles) and twin-stick shooting, proper arcade style. The combat is rather dynamic, but not overly hard, and the exploration part is not tedious, because of the need to switch around characters to figure out how to use their abilities to push forward.

I did enjoy it a lot - and I'm happy that it wasn't artificially lengthened and dragged for hours. It was really enjoyable and didn't get boring at all. If you want to try it then you actually can! There is a demo version, which is basically the first 1 hour of the game - it's really cool for people that are not sure if the game fits them. And another wink into 80s gaming ;)
