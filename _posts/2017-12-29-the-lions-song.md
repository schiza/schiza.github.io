Chill, relaxing adventure game, with a really nice story.

It was released in episodes, but after they are all released - it doesn't really matter. Each episode is a story about a different person, showing different perspectives on many apsects of life. But they are all intertwined in some way, which is a really nice touch and makes the depicted world not sterile and stories not separated from each other.

There are a lot of things shown in the game - emotions, different environments, real life problems, career struggles and decisions. Each chapter has also some unique mechanics (although you need to remember, it's a story point & click game) which are very closely related to the area of interest of the character and their own traits.

There are quite some choices in the game, that will affect what will (or not) happen next, and influence other stories. There's not a lot of them (it's a small game, you don't want hundreds of choices in a 4 hour game) but they do matter. There is a mechanism of changing your decisions afterwards, or just replay episodes, but honestly I didn't try it.

Pixel-like art and washed up colors work really well and they are really good-looking. Although there is no voice acting, it is not needed - dialogues are really well done and they express a lot, even if only in text. Sounds are sparse, but really well done, and music... Yes, music is a big part of the game. It's not constantly there, but it fits perfectly where it's needed - great classical tunes are really fitting.

If one likes story games, and needs something to chill and relax - I totally recommend it. Great game for a cold evening with a cup of hot tea.
