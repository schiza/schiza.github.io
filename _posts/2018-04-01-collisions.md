Use machinery to move the ball forward!

You are left with a ball. It seems you need to move it to the next area. Use different machines that are available, move some switches and time your actions to achieve the goal. The game plays with different kinds of machineries, springs, trap doors, hooks and quite some other stuff. Many of them require a lot of precision, other timings and other - a mixture of those, along with understanding and utilizing movement patterns. Oh, and pinball flippers - you need to master them a bit ;)

The aesthetic is really cool - all foreground elements are just black - so you only see their shapes, nothing else. It gives a minimalistic vibe, which focuses you even more on finding the solution. As a small game, it's really good - plays a bit with couple of mechanics, precision and timing. Good game to challenge yourself and train you patience, finishing it in one sitting.
