Second season of Telltale's story about Batman.

I really enjoyed the Telltale's first season of Batman - their own interpretation of the story, with a really interesting approach to Joker especially. It was interesting, but more of a promise to deliver something even better further on. And they really did.

The game is really about the story, so I won't spoil too much. For someone being a fan of Telltale's games, they are still doing it well. There aren't very big changes to their games in general, no real big changes in mechanics, but they quite polished their craft. The game offers some pseudo-quick time events during the game, and some minor decisions how to act (e.g. during combats), just to give some good pacing into the story. But the story is where this one actually shines.

Well, maybe not so much the story, as the characters. By all means, the story is really good, but the best part are the creations if characters in the game - especially the ones that are known from other Batman stories. The new and fresh approach of Jok.. I mean John Doe will get even more lively and approach it's resolution at the end. Gordon is still there, being the good cop in the midst of it. We will see more depths in Alfred. More villains will show up. But to be completely honest, I was amazed by representation of Harley Quinn. This interpretation really shown an interesting villain - really brutal and ruthless, quite crazy and playing the role of a sweet and innocent... just on the outside and when it doesn't matter. She shows that she is the boss, she's cunning and very intelligent. Which makes her really scary. Her relationship with Joker is also something new, you could even say with reversed roles. I think they pictured her perfectly and she really outshined everyone.

From technical side, we still get quite a lot of story (around 11 hours of gameplay in 5 episodes), with voice acting done pretty well and nice bit of music. They also introduced some "summary" bits at the end of the episodes, showing your relation with main characters and decisions that lead to it - it's a nice addition to just "X% of players did that too".

The second season bought me again - and I hope they will continue the story, as not all things were closed yet.. but for now, let them focus on the last season of The Walking Dead!
